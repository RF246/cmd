# Terminal
A really simple command-line interpreter application written in C#.</br>
I don't recommend using this as a replacement for Command Prompt or whatever you use (if you're even thinking about it in the first place.) It's really bare-bones and doesn't support Git or any third-party commands.</br>
I made this simple app because I was bored, I learned a lot!
