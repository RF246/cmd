# Terminal
## About
A really simple command-line interpreter application written in C#. I strongly recommend to <strong>NOT</strong> use this.</br>
I made this simple app because I was bored, I learned a lot!
## Build Guide
1. Download [.NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) if you haven't already.
2. Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/) if you haven't already.
3. Download [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and set it up for .NET desktop applications if you haven't already. Maybe Visual Studio Code works as well, I'm not really sure, haha.
4. Open up Command Prompt, or whatever terminal application you use, change the directory to whatever you prefer. For example, I would use the desktop, therefore I would type `cd C:\Users\James\Desktop` to change my directory to my desktop.
5. Run `git clone https://github.com/spareyogurt/terminal`
6. There you go! You're now ready to contribute to the Terminal project!
